## Hi there 👋, I'm Rishad

I'm a Computer Science and Economics student at the University of Waterloo with a passion for building impactful software. I enjoy working across the stack—from backend services to frontend interfaces—and thrive in collaborative, fast-paced environments.

I’m currently working as a **Senior SWE at TriviaLinked (Part-time)**, where I help architect and ship features for the fast-growing daily trivia game in iOS. 🧠🔗
